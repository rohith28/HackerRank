## Problem Statement
There are two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll ever land at the same location at the same time?

## Input Format

A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of x1,v1, x2,and v2.

Constraints:
* -1 < x1 < x2 < 10001
* 0< v1 < 10001
* 0< v2 < 10001



## Output Format

Print YES if they can land on the same location at the same time; otherwise, print NO.

## Note: 
The two kangaroos must land at the same location after making the same number of jumps.

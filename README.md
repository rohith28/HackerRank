## HackerRank

This repository holds solutions in various languages for problems from HackerRank.

It's mostly used for practicing random things and learning new languages, but I'll happily accept any pull requests if you want to add a valid solution in your favorite language.

If you find any issues with the solutions in the repository because problem statements have changed over time, open an issue and I'll check it out.
